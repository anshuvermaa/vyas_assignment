# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a full-stack Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Hook Form**, **@tanstack/react-query** on the frontend and **Node.js**, **Express**, **Prisma**, **Body-parser**, **Cors** on the backend. Users can play the game, save and retrieve games to continue playing at a later time.

## Features

- **Save Game**: Users can save their current game and come back to finish it later.
